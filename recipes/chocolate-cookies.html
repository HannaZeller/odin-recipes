        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is the recipe to delicious and very chocolaty cookies. It is based on this <a href="https://www.lecker.de/cookies-rezept-fuer-den-einfachen-grundteig-15241.html">basic cookie dough recipe</a>.
        </p>  

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>125g room temperature butter</li>
                <li>100g sugar</li>
                <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
                <li>1 sachet vanilla sugar</li>
                <li>1 medium egg</li>
                <li>150g flour</li>
                <li>50g cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>100g dark chocolate</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix butter, sugar, vanilla sugar, salt and the egg in a bowl until well combined and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>Add in flour, cocoa powder and baking powder until mix only until combined. </li>
            <li>Chop the chocolate into pieces (depending on your preference you can make them smaller, or leave them really chunky for chocolate bursts in the cookie). 
            Mix in the chocolate chunks into the batter. </li>
            <li>On a baking sheet, put around a teaspoon of dough for each cookie. Don't worry about forming them too much, they spread in the oven anyway.  </li>
            <li>Bake the cookies at 150°C in a convection oven (in a non-convection oven maybe at 170°C) for around 10 minutes. If you have the will-power to, let them cool down a bit. They come out the oven a bit soft, but get slightly harder when cooled down. </li>
            <li>Eat all of them in one sitting and burn your fingers slightly because you have none of the mentioned will-power. </li>
        </ol>
