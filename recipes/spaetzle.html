        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spätzle are a type of German egg noodle. They are quite easy to make and only require very few ingredients. <br>
            In Germany, you can also buy them ready made, but nothing beats self made Spätzle. <br>
            You can use them in a variety of dishes like Kässpätzle, or as a side to meat and a nice sauce. </p>
