        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spätzle are a type of German egg noodle. They are quite easy to make and only require very few ingredients. <br>
            In Germany, you can also buy them ready made, but nothing beats self made Spätzle. <br>
            You can use them in a variety of dishes like Kässpätzle, or as a side to meat and a nice sauce. </p>
            <p>There are different kinds and different methods of preparation. For the one I am describing, you will need a Spätzlehobel to form the Spätzle. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 eggs</li>
            <li>1 dash sparkling water</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the eggs with the salt and sparkling water. </li>
            <li>Add flour to the mixture. How much you ask? 
                <ul>
                    <li>You are German: Until your ancestors tell you to stop. </li>
                    <li>You are not German: Until the dough has a very thick consistency, but not too thick or it will be harder to get it trough the Spätzlehobel. <br>
                        May the Spätzlegods be with you. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Bring salty water in a large pot to a boil. When it boils, put your Spätzlehobel on top of the pot and add some dough to it. <br>
            Use the scraper of the Spätzlehobel to press the dough through the holes into the hot water. Let the Spätzle boil in the water and remove them from the water. 
            <li>Repeat until all your dough is gone. </li>
            </li>
        </ol>
