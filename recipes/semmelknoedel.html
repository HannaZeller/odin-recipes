        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Semmelknödel are amazing and one of my favourite foods (I have great taste). <br>
            They use old Semmeln (bread rolls) that are too old and dry to be enjoyed anymore and make them into a fabulous meal. <br>
        They can be a side dish to meat and a nice sauce, but they can also be the star of the whole meal in a nice creamy mushroom sauce for example. <br>Even on their own, cut into slices and pan fried in butter, they are absolutely delicious!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 old and dry Semmeln (bread rolls)</li>
            <li>3 tbsp. parsley (put lots) </li>
            <li>10g butter</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>250ml milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>bread crumbs depending on consistency</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the Semmeln into small cubes or thin slices. Put chopped parsley and onion into a pot with the butter and heat it up (but don't let it get brown), then mix with the bread cubes. <br>
                Bring the milk almost to a boil and pour over the bread. Leave the mixture for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Mix the eggs with the salt and pepper and add them to the bread mixutre. Knead until it becomes a firm dough. If it is too wet, add bread crumbs. </li>
            <li>With wet hands form tennis ball sized Knödel and put them into hot (but not boiling) salt water. Wait for 20 minutes until the Knödel float to the surfice. </li>
        </ol>
