        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Semmelknödel are amazing and one of my favourite foods (I have great taste). <br>
            They use old Semmeln (bread rolls) that are too old and dry to be enjoyed anymore and make them into a fabulous meal. <br>
        They can be a side dish to meat and a nice sauce, but they can also be the star of the whole meal in a nice creamy mushroom sauce for example. <br>Even on their own, cut into slices and pan fried in butter, they are absolutely delicious!</p>
